## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- Vite for development and build process
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### What I learned

In the styling part, I break the UI into manageable components and use as many utilities classes as possible to reduce the amount of custom styling. However, I purge the final css of all unused utility classes to ensure the final css is as small as possible.

```scss
// Generate font-weight utility classes with responsive variants
@each $weight, $value in $font-weights {
	.text-#{$weight} {
		font-weight: #{$value};
	}
}

// Generate font-style utility classes with responsive variants
@each $style, $value in $font-styles {
	.text-#{$style} {
		font-style: #{$value};
	}
}

// Generate text-align utility classes with responsive variants
@each $align, $value in $text-aligns {
	.text-#{$align} {
		text-align: #{$value};
	}
}

// Generate font-weight utility classes with responsive variants
@each $weight, $value in $font-weights {
	@each $breakpoint, $breakpoint-value in $breakpoints {
		@media screen and (min-width: #{$breakpoint-value}) {
			@at-root .#{$breakpoint}-text-#{$weight} {
				font-weight: #{$value};
			}
		}
	}
}

// Generate font-style utility classes with responsive variants
@each $style, $value in $font-styles {
	@each $breakpoint, $breakpoint-value in $breakpoints {
		@media screen and (min-width: #{$breakpoint-value}) {
			@at-root .#{$breakpoint}-text-#{$style} {
				font-style: #{$value};
			}
		}
	}
}

// Generate text-align utility classes with responsive variants
@each $align, $value in $text-aligns {
	@each $breakpoint, $breakpoint-value in $breakpoints {
		@media screen and (min-width: #{$breakpoint-value}) {
			@at-root .#{$breakpoint}-text-#{$align} {
				text-align: #{$value};
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced SASS features to enhance the maintainability and scalability of my stylesheets. I also intend to further integrate TypeScript in future frontend projects to reinforce type safety and streamline debugging.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was instrumental in implementing the flexible layout of the component.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Display Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) - Helped me with controlling element visibility.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Engaging with other developers in the community provided insights and useful tips for handling responsive layouts.
